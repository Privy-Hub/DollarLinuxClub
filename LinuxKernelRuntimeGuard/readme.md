Linux Kernel Runtime Guard (LKRG)

Linux Kernel Runtime Integrity Checking and Exploit Detection.

LKRG provides security through diversity. Similar to running an uncommon operating system (kernel) would.

It renders whole classes of kernel exploits ineffective. Makes other exploits less reliable and more difficult to write (see features [1] and security [2]). LKRG was developed by a security professional with review from other high profile security professionals (see authorship [3]).

This is a lightweight software fork [4] of LKRG, with a focus on easy installation, added user documentation, and integration with Whonix [5], Kicksecure [6], Debian [7], and other distributions. The LKRG Debian Package Website can be found here. [8] No changes to or review of the core source code of LKRG. The software fork source code can be found here. [9] Original LKRG upstream can be found here. [10]
