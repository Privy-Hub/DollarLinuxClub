Blockstack
	
	blockstack is not a product even founders build apps on it considering they hold no actual power over the ecosystem other than their blockstack.id 
	which you can replace by your own. 
	it act as a kind of gateway/ecosystem rather than a blockchain based software
	. Users own their data inside a wallet instead of 3rd party
	they use atlas networking BNS for the dns level

	blockstack auth provide way to auth within apps 
	it mainly done locally the website only receive a OTP which is good for a single transactions
	
	blockstack storage like gaia which can be replaced by ipfs if you wish.
	they do not restrict you, you can either run their free gaia node or start your own.
