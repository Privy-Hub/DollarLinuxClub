Stubby

A YAML configuration file for Stubby containing a the details of these servers is provided with Stubby and can be found here. This file enables only the subset of servers operated by the stubby/getdns developers by default, users can choose to enable any of the other servers by uncommenting the relevant section (occasionally the file lags this page).

**Note that the Yeti servers use a different root key for DNSSEC! See the Yeti project for more details
