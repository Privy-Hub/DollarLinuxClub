#### Setting shadowsocks server in remote server

Follow the offcial [instruction](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-libev) to install shadowsocks-libev

Configure shadowsocks server with udp-relay option enabled

#### Setting shadowsocks client in local udp-relay server

Install shadowsocks-libev in local udp-relay server

Setting forward

Tunneling local 53 port to 8.8.8.8:53


/etc/default/shadowsocks-libev

```
# Defaults for shadowsocks initscript
# sourced by /etc/init.d/shadowsocks-libev
# installed at /etc/default/shadowsocks-libev by the maintainer scripts

#
# This is a POSIX shell fragment
#
# Note: `START', `GROUP' and `MAXFD' options are not recognized by systemd.
# Please change those settings in the corresponding systemd unit file.

# Enable during startup?
START=yes

# Configuration file
CONFFILE="/etc/shadowsocks-libev/config.json"

# Extra command line arguments
DAEMON_ARGS="-L 8.8.8.8:53 -u"

# User and group to run the server as
USER=root
GROUP=root

# Number of maximum file descriptors
MAXFD=32768
```

/etc/shadowsocks-libev/config.json

```

{
    "server":"<server ip>",
    "local_address":"<udp relay server's local ip>",
    "server_port":<server port>,
    "local_port":53,
    "password":"<password>",
    "timeout":60,
    "method":"aes-256-cfb"
}

```

So if we using 192.168.1.253 as DNS Server, we using the 8.8.8.8 via
shadowsocks tunnel

#### Using bind server to make a full function DNS Server

You can find [Basic bind9 configuration for lan](https://github.com/hardenedlinux/Debian-GNU-Linux-Profiles/blob/master/docs/dns/basic-bind9-cfg-for-lan.md)

And setting it as recursive DNS

add 192.168.1.253 (tunnel DNS address in local) to /etc/resolv.conf as primary
dns server and add another DNS server address as secondary

/etc/resolv.conf

```
nameserver 192.168.1.253
nameserver 114.114.114.114
```

So in our local network, we can simply using 192.168.1.254 as our DNS server,
it use *REAL* 8.8.8.8 to reslove DNS request, and fallback with
114.114.114.114
