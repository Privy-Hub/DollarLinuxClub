Deploy Bro as an IDS Keyword: IDS, Bro, file capabilities. Build Bro

Install dependencies.

Debian 9 have introduced Bro, so # apt-get build-dep could be invoked:
apt-get build-dep bro
apt-get install swig swig3.0 python-dev python3-dev git

or install all the build dependencies (which could be extracted from the output of $ apt-cache showsrc bro) by hand:
apt-get install debhelper cmake binpac btest bison flex \

rsync libbind-dev libcurl-dev, libreadline-dev libgeoip-dev
libgoogle-perftools-dev libpcap-dev libsqlite3-dev libssl1.0-dev
libxml2-dev zlib1g-dev swig swig3.0 python-dev python3-dev git

Currently the latest stable version of Broker depends on EXACT actor-framework version 0.15, which can hardly be built, so a Bro without Broker is going to be built:

$ git clone --recursive git://git.bro.org/bro $ cd bro $ git checkout origin/release/2.5 $ ./configure --disable-broker --prefix=/usr/local $ make -j$(nproc)
make install

Essential Configuration
mkdir -p /var/log/bro
mkdir -p /var/spool/bro

Modify the following options inside /usr/local/etc/broctl.cfg like below:

... MailTo = you@example.com ... LogDir = /var/log/bro ... SpoolDir = /var/spool/bro ... CfgDir = /usr/local/etc

Edit the /usr/local/etc/networks.cfg file and add each network (using standard CIDR notation) that is considered local to the monitored environment, e.g., when bro is deployed on the server to monitor itself, which has the address 221.221.221.221/18, the networks.cfg should contain the following content:

221.221.192.0/18 monitored network

With all config files adjusted, run the following command to update broctl installation/configuration:
broctl install

Now bro is functional. You can invoke
broctl start

to start it, and
broctl stop

to shut it down. Log files will be written into /var/log/bro, and raw monitor results will be saved into /var/spool/bro. Bro policies

The local customizable bro script is located at /usr/local/share/bro/site/local.bro, which has already contained several predefined @load instructions, so you could load modules you want, e.g. add

@load policy/misc/scan

to load /usr/local/share/bro/policy/misc/scan.bro module. You can also write your own modules via bro script language and load them. Daemonize Bro
adduser --system --home /var/spool/bro --disabled-login bro
chown -R bro:adm /var/spool/bro
chown -R bro:adm /var/log/bro
chown bro /usr/local/bin/bro
setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip /usr/local/bin/bro

then write /etc/systemd/system/bro.service:

[Unit] Description=Bro IDS After=network.target

[Service] User=bro Type=forking Environment=HOME=/var/spool/bro ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/broctl start ExecReload=/usr/local/bin/broctl restart ExecStop=/usr/local/bin/broctl stop

[Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target

After this service file installed
systemctl enable bro.service

the bro system is configured as a daemon.
